# Dataset for projects

Name | Description | Source
---|---|---
[Credit_Risk_Analysis](https://github.com/mblinks/dataset/blob/main/credit_risk.csv) | This dataset provides essential information about loan applicants and their characteristics. The task is to develop predictive models to determine the likelihood of loan default based on these simplified features. | [1](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nanditapore/credit-risk-analysis ) 
[Maternal Health Risk Analysis](https://github.com/mblinks/dataset/blob/main/Maternal_Risk.csv) | This dataset provides essential information about loan applicants and their characteristics. The task is to develop predictive models to determine the likelihood of loan default based on these simplified features. | [2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drmbsharma/maternal-health-risk-data-set)
[Pet Box Subscription](https://github.com/mblinks/dataset/blob/main/pet_box_subscription.csv) | This dataset provides essential information about a company's pet box subscription history. The task is to determine how repeat purchases will affect sales. | [3](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/5898db15-eb36-410e-926a-2b24befe78f0/edit )
[Fitness Class Subscription](https://github.com/mblinks/dataset/blob/main/fitness_class_subscription.csv) | This dataset provides information about the subscription status of members of a fitness class. The task is to predict whether a member will attend class or not so that a space can be created. | [4](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/37a0f7ab-c69a-42d4-b77d-dcdbae3845dc/edit )
[Product Sales Analysis](https://github.com/mblinks/dataset/blob/main/product_sales.csv) | This dataset provides information about a company's sales approach record over a period of time. The task is to determine the number of customers for each sales approach, the overall spread of the revenue for each method, the difference if any in revenue over time for each of the methods, other differences (if any) between the customers in each group, and recommendation on sales method to use based on the available data. | [5](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/1c04ff02-7a5a-4bd0-b626-ecc184574eb2/edit )
[Recipe Site Traffic Prediction](https://github.com/mblinks/dataset/blob/main/recipe_site_traffic.csv) | This dataset provides information from the traffic generated by recipes displayed on a company site. The task is to develop predictive models that can predict high-traffic recipes 80% of the time. | [6](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/8b775030-daf3-44d4-b912-3de19b05845d/edit)
